# Chatbot Sports Conversation Generation

**Chatbot Sports Conversation Generation** is an AI-powered project aimed at emulating dynamic, humorous, and engaging conversations in a group chat setting. Inspired by real-life group chat interactions, this chatbot project generates dialogues based on sports news, mimicking distinct personalities and conversational styles.

## Project Overview

This chatbot takes sports news as input and generates simulated conversations between predefined group chat characters. By scraping sports articles and extracting key information, the chatbot produces interactions that reflect the personalities, humor, and opinions of each character.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Personality Emulation**: Each character has a unique tone, style, and personality, bringing life to every conversation.
- **Sports Content Scraping**: The bot can process sports articles, extracting essential details to use as conversation starters.
- **Adjustable Tone and Style**: Users can set the tone of the conversation, from sarcastic and humorous to sincere or analytical.

### Goals and Roadmap

This project is currently under active development. Future goals include:
- **Advanced NLP**: Leveraging advanced natural language processing to enhance conversation flow and context.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Ensuring the chatbot remembers previous interactions for a more natural feel.
- **Frontend User Interface**: Creating a simple, user-friendly UI where users can input links to sports articles and select conversation tones.
- **Expanded Character Customization**: Allowing users to adjust character traits and personality settings.
